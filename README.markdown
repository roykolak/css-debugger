... with additional tweaks and additions

The purpose of these styles are to highlight malformed, incorrect, incomplete,
and wrongly nested HTML tags that would otherwise not be visible to the eye. Using these styles, HTML tags that match any of the
above conditions will be highlighted with a thick dotted border with a color that
reflects on the offense.
